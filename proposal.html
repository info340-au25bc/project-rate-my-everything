            <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
            <p>
                People face all kinds of decisions every day, ranging from small choices like what to eat for lunch to major ones such as
                 choosing a career path. However, not every decision has a Reddit thread or a ranking app like Letterboxd to help guide the process.
                Exploring and weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each option can also be time-consuming.

                To make decision making more efficient, there are several platforms that allow users to rate, rank, and share opinions on specific topics. For instance, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a>
                 enables users to review and comment on movies, providing useful insights for others who are unsure about what to watch. Similarly,
                  <a href="https://www.google.com/maps"> Google Maps </a> allows users to view ratings and feedback for various buildings or stores. The major limitation of these platforms
                 is that each focuses on only one category of information, forcing users to switch between multiple sources to gather all the details they need.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>To address this problem, we are developing a web app that allows users to log and rate anything they want. Unlike existing rating platforms such as Letterboxd or Goodreads, which focus on specific categories like movies or books, our app will support any type of item or experience the user chooses to track.</p>
            <p>Our target audience includes anyone who wants a personal space to record and reflect on their opinions and experiences. The features of the app are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(1) When adding a new entry, users can first select a category, such as food they’ve tried, a place they’ve visited, or media they’ve consumed, and then provide a rating, write a description, and optionally upload an image.</li>
                <li>(1.5) As users add to their history of logs, they can browse and search their entries with ordering and filtering options, such as rating score, date, and category.</li>
                <li>(2.5) Entries can also be grouped into customizable lists, such as “favorite restaurants in Seattle” or “top movies of the year”. Additionally, users will have the option to create a wishlist of things they’d like to try or experience in the future.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because all the data in this project will be user-generated, we will not need to rely on external APIs or datasets</p>
