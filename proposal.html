                People face all kinds of decisions every day, ranging from small choices like what to eat for lunch to major ones such as
                 choosing a career path. However, not every decision has a Reddit thread or a ranking app like <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a> to help guide the process.
                Exploring and weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each option can also be time-consuming. To make decision making more efficient,
                 there are several platforms that allow users to rate, rank, and share opinions on specific topics. For instance, Letterboxd
                 enables users to review and comment on movies, providing useful insights for others who are unsure about what to watch. Similarly,
                  <a href="https://www.google.com/maps"> Google Maps </a> allows users to view ratings and feedback for various buildings or stores. The major limitation of these platforms
                 is that each focuses on only one category of information, forcing users to switch between multiple sources to gather all the details they need.
